Installing and setting up Loom on Windows

Currently the only way to use Loom on windows is to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Once you install that you can continue on and follow the steps under [Prerequisites Ubuntu](prereqs-ubuntu.html).
