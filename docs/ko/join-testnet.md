This doc is for developers on how they can join the Plasmachain Testnet to do deployment. If you are looking for information on how to run nodes, or to become a validator please checkout [Validator Guide](validator.html)

**Prerequisite**

- Loom installed (see [instruction](https://loomx.io/developers/en/basic-install-osx.html#installation) )

```bash
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loomnetwork/loom-sdk-documentation/master/scripts/get_loom.sh | sh
```

**How to generate a private key with Loom and get your public address**

    $ ./loom genkey -k priv_key -a pub_key
    

result

```bash
local address: 0x3B334bEd1e7d3e7d9214495120160D9236aCbC31
local address base64: OzNL7R59Pn2SFElRIBYNkjasvDE=
```

and this will create files named `priv_key` and `pub_key`, the `priv_key` file contains your private key that you'll use to deploy contracts to the DAppChain.

# Deploy Truffle Example to a Testnet

1. Make sure you have node and yarn/npm installed
2. Obtain the testnet URL from [PlasmaChain Testnets](testnet-plasma.html) page
3. Get the source: 
        bash
        git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/truffle-dappchain-example
        cd truffle-dappchain-example
        # copy the private key generated earlier to the root directory of the example repo
        cp ../priv_key extdev_private_key

4. If you wish to deploy the example contracts to `extdev-plasma-us1` skip this step. Otherwise, add the network you wish to deploy to in `truffle-config.js`.
5. Install node modules: 
        bash
        yarn

6. Run deploy: 
        bash
        yarn deploy:extdev
