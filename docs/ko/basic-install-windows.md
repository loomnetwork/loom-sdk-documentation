Installing and setting up Loom on Windows

Currently the only way to use Loom on windows is to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Once you install that you can continue on below and run the Linux install steps.

wget https://private.delegatecall.com/loom/linux/stable/loom
chmod +x loom

./loom init
```

## Run Blockchain

    ./loom run
