A basic example showcasing a simple HTML5 game interacting with a Loom DappChain, using [Phaser](http://phaser.io) and [Loom.js](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-js). Souce code is available on [Github](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo)

## Game instructions

Use the arrow keys to move around, jump by pressing the up arrow. For each passing row of blocks, 1 point is awarded. Collect bonus stars to increase your score further.

## Development

1.) Run your own DappChain

Install Loom

```bash
wget https://private.delegatecall.com/loom/osx/stable/loom
chmod +x loom

mkdir contracts
wget -O contracts/blueprint.0.0.1 https://private.delegatecall.com/weave-blueprint/osx/build-9/blueprint.0.0.1
chmod +x contracts/blueprint.0.0.1

./loom init
cp ../genesis.example.json genesis.json
```

Run Blockchain

    ./loom run
    

Please consult the [Loom SDK docs](https://loomx.io/developers/en/prereqs.html) for further instruction on running your own DappChain.
