## Overview

Hardware security modules ensure that private keys of the validator are not compromised even if a machine is hacked. We are highly encouraging all validators on Basechain to have one for starters. In future the chain may make it a requirement to have one to participate as a validator

## Supported Devices

Right now we will only support devices that can do EDDSA encryption with the ED25519 algorithm. Currently we support the [Yubico HSM2](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubihsm/), an economically cheap device at around $500 that supports a wide array of encryption algorithms including those used for bitcoin/ethereum signing. Also we'll soon support other PKCS11 enabled devices that can do EDDSA encryption.

## Configuring an HSM

In loom.yml you need to add the following section

```yaml
HsmConfig:
  HsmEnabled: true
  HsmDevType: yubihsm
  HsmConnUrl: "localhost:12345"
  HsmAuthPassword: "password"
  HsmAuthKeyId: 1
  HsmSignKeyID: 0
```

## Config options

* HsmEnabled

Must be set to true to enable signing with the HSM device, if set to false the other setting are ignored.

* HsmDevType: 

Options - yubihsm, softhsm (coming soon), pkcs11 (coming soon)

* HsmConnUrl:

Http url for the yubicohsm, by default it listens to http://localhost:12345

* HsmAuthPassword: 

Password for the HSM device. (previously HsmDevLogCred)

* HsmAuthKeyId:

ID number for authentication on the yubico hsm. This typically will be set to 1 as its the default AuthKeyId

* SignKeyDomain:

Yubico HSMs allow multiple domains for security, you can specify, otherwise it defaults to 1

* HsmSignKeyID:

ID number of the private key on the HSM, we suggest to create this in advance. If you set this value to zero, Loom SDK will attempt to create a new private key on the HSM itself.

## Setting up the Yubico HSM

1. Download yubico drivers, utils

<https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/> We require version 1.04 or greater.

2. Install the yubico drivers 

```bash
dpkg -i *.deb 
```

3. Run the yubico connector

```bash
yubihsm-connector -d 
```

4. Create your first private key

```bash
yubihsm-shell
connect
keepalive 25
session open 1 password
generate asymmetric 0 100 label_eddsa_sign 1,2,3 export_under_wrap,asymmetric_sign_eddsa ed25519
session close 0
quit
```

You should now have a key at with ID 100. Please set HsmSignKeyId to 100 in your loom.yml

### Using HSM for signing transactions like Register Canidate

1. Find out your PrivateKeyId and base64 public key

cat chaindata/config/priv_validator.json

get key_id and pub_key/value

2. Create hsm.json

```json
hsm.json
{
    "YubiHsmConnURL":"localhost:12345",
    "AuthKeyID":1,
    "Password":"password",
    "PrivKeyID":999999 
}
```

put your key id into the privKeyID field

3. ./loom call register_candidateV2 PUBLIC_KEY_IN_BASE64 10 --hsmconfig hsm.json -r http://dposv2.dappchains.com:80/query -w http://dposv2.dappchains.com:80/rpc --chain dposv2

swap PUBLIC_KEY_IN_BASE64 for the one in the priv_validator
