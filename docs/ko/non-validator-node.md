## Validator and Non-Validator Nodes

Validator nodes are required to:

- actively participate in consensus (that is they propose new blocks and vote on them),
- be always online,
- post collateral.

However, none of this is necessary to run a non-validator node. Simply put, non-validator nodes just verify the new blocks and keep up with the consensus protocol. Thus, joining as a non-validator is much simpler.

## How to Run a Non-Validator Node

Follow the instructions at [Extdev jump start](jump-start-extdev-plasma-us1.html) to spin up your own non-validator node.
