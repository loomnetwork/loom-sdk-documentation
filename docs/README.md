The karma module provides a way to limit Transactions.
Users are limited in the number and timing of transactions by various karma parameters. There
is one user called the Oracle who has unlimited access. 

## Installation

To install, include the karma contract in the genesis.json file when starting the
chain for the first time.
```json
     {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "karma",
            "location": "karma:1.0.0",
            "init": {
            }
     }

```
  
## Activation and loom.yaml

Activating the karma functionality is done from the loom.yaml configuration file.
* `KarmaEnabled bool` Flag that sets the karma module on or off. 
* `KarmaSessionDuration int64` A Time period in seconds. Karma restricts users to a configurable
 number of transactions during any interval of `SessionDuration` seconds.
* `KarmaMaxCallCount int64` Base value used to calculate number of call Transaction permitted per `SessionDuration`.
A `KarmaMaxCallCount int64` of `0` indicates there are no limit imposed on call transactions number.
* `KarmaMaxDeployCount int64` Base value used to calculate number of deploy Transaction permitted per `SessionDuration`.
A `KarmaMaxDeployCount int64` of `0` indicates there are no limit imposed on deploy transactions number.
Example loom.yaml fragment.
```yaml
KarmaEnabled: true
KarmaSessionDuration: 60
KarmaMaxCallCount: 10
KarmaMaxDeployCount: 5
```

## Accessing karma methods
Public karma methods can either be run either directly in code using one of the SDKs 
or from the command line the using `loom` executable.
```bash
$ ./loom karma --help

call a method of karma

Usage:
  loom karma [command]

Available Commands:
  append-sources-for-user add new source of karma to a user, requires oracle verification
  delete-sources-for-user delete sources assigned to user, requires oracle verification
  get-sources             list the karma sources
  get-total               calculate total karma for user
  get-user-state          list the karma sources for user
  reset-sources           reset the sources, requires oracle verification
  update-oracle           change the oracle or set initial oracle


Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -h, --help             help for karma
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")

Use "loom karma [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Oracle
* It is defined in the genesis file, and can be updated by the karma method UpdateOracle.
* It is unaffected by karma restrictions.
* To successfully call the following karma configuration transactions it is necessary to
reference the oracle.
    * `AppendSourcesForUser`
    * `DeleteSourcesForUser`
    * `ResetSources`
    * `UpdateOracle` If no oracle has been set yet then anyone can call `UpdateOracle`, 
    If an oracle has been set it is necssary to know the old oracle to change the oracle
    with `UpdateOracle`. 
    
Example genesis file entry.
 ```json
    {
        "vm": "plugin",
        "format": "plugin",
        "name": "karma",
        "location": "karma:1.0.0",
        "init": {
                "Oracle": {
                    "chainId": "default",
                    "local": "QjWhaN9qvpdI9MjS1YuL1GukwLc="
                }
        }
    }
```
###### loom karma update-oracle 
The oracle can be updated using the `loom update-oracle` command, which uses the UpdateOracle karma
method
```bash
$ loom karma update-oracle --help
change the oracle

Usage:
  loom karma update-oracle (new oracle) [old oracle] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for update-oracle

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")
```
Changes the oracle from `old oracle` to `new oracle`.  
For example if default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90 is the current oracle
```bash
$ karma update-oracle   default:0xAfaA41C81A316111fB0A4644B7a276c26bEA2C9F default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90  -k ./cmd/loom/data/pri
oracle changed
```
The old oracle can be omitted if no oracle has been set yet.
## Sources
Karma is generated by sources. Sources could correspond to different user types,
privilege levels, promotions or temporary changes in status.
```go
type KarmaSourceReward struct {
    Name   string
    Reward int64
}
```
`Name`is a descriptive string used to identify a source.
`Reward`is used to multiply karma associated with the source. A high `Reward` value means
 each point of karma generated by the source has more effect than a source with a lower `Reward`.
 
 Sources can be configured in the genesis file or later by calling the karma GetSources
 and ResetSources methods.
 
 ### Sources: Genesis File
 Sources can be set up in the karma `init` segment of the DAppChain genesis file. 
 This allows sources to be available the first time the DAppChain is run. For example:
 ```json
    {
        "vm": "plugin",
        "format": "plugin",
        "name": "karma",
        "location": "karma:1.0.0",
        "init": {
            "Params": {
                "sources": [
                    {
                        "name": "sms",
                        "reward": "1"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "oauth",
                        "reward": "3"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "token",
                        "reward": "4"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
```
This starts the DAppChain with three sources, "sms", "oauth" and "token" with varying reward levels.

### Sources: ResetSources
The karma method `ResetSources` is used to reset the karma parameters including the sources
in a running DAppChain. 
You might want to download the existing parameters with `GetSources` and amend that before
using to set the karma configuration parameters with `UpdateConfig`. 

###### loom karma get-sources
Use the get-sources `loom` command to list karma sources using the GetSources karma method. 
```bash
$ loom karma get-sources --help
list the karma sources

Usage:
  loom karma get-sources [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for get-sources

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")

Process finished with exit code 0
```
For example
```bash
$ loom karma get-sources
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "sms",
      "reward": "1"
    },
    {
      "name": "oauth",
      "reward": "3"
    },
    {
      "name": "token",
      "reward": "4"
    }
  ]
}
```
###### loom karma reset-sources
The sources can be reset using the ResetSources karma method reached via the
`loom karma update-sources` command. If you want to
add to existing sources will might want to use `loom karma get-sources` to get those existing
sources.
```bash
$ loom karma reset-sources --help
reset the sources

Usage:
  loom karma reset-sources (oracle) [ [source] [reward] ]... [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for update-sources

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")

```
For example if `default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90` has previous been set as the
oracle.
```bash
$ loom karma reset-sources default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90 "oauth" 3 "token" 5 "test" 7
sources successfully updated
```

##### go-loom update sources
The following Go code fragment gives an example of how you might do this in Go using go-loom, 
error checking skipped for readability.
```go
import `github.com/loomnetwork/go-loom/builtin/types/karma`

func AddSource(name string, reward int64, signer auth.Signer, oracle loom.Address, karmaContact client.Contract) {

	// Get the existing configuration parameters
	var resp karma.KarmaSources
	_, err := karmaContact.StaticCall("GetSources", oracle.MarshalPB(), oracle, &resp)
	
	// Add the new source
	var configVal karma.KarmaSourcesValidator
	configVal.Oracle = oracle.MarshalPB()
	configVal.Sources = append(resp.Sources, &karma.KarmaSourceReward {
            Name: name,
            Reward: reward,
	})
	
	// Update the source information on the DAppChain
	_, err = karmaContact.Call("ResetSources", &configVal, signer, nil)
}
```
## Users
If karma has been enabled, each user will be restricted in the transactions they can
call by their karma allocation. If karma is enabled the following restrictions apply.

###### Deploy transactions
A strictly positive karma is required to do any transactions.

If `KarmaMaxDeployCount` is zero then there is no limit, imposed here, on the rate of 
deploy transactions.

Otherwise users will only be able to run `KarmaMaxDeployCount` deploy transactions in any 
period of `SessionDuration`seconds. 

###### Call transactions
A strictly positive karma is required to do any transactions.

If `KarmaMaxCallCount` is zero then there is no limit, imposed here,  
on the rate of call transactions.

Otherwise users will only be able to run `KarmaMaxCallCount + total karma` call transactions in any 
period of `SessionDuration`seconds. Where `total karma1` is calculated from the count of sources
held by the user as described below.

### #User Karma
Each user will be associated with zero or more sources. This list may contain both active sources, 
in karma's current list of sources, or inactive sources not currently in the list of current sources.  
```go
type KarmaSource struct {
	Name  string
	Count int64 
}

type KarmaAddressSource struct {
	User    *types.Address 
	Sources []*KarmaSource 
}
```
`Name` identifies a source and corresponds to the `Name` field in `KarmaSourceReward` above.
`Count` the number of a particular source associated with the address.
The karma source provides to a user is `

`KarmaSource.Count*KarmaSourceReward.Reward`

The total amount of karma is the sum of the karma from each active karma source associated with the user.
The sources associated with a user can configured either in the genesis file or by the karma 
methods `AppendSourcesForUser` and `DeleteSourcesForUser`.

#### Users: Genesis File
Users can be associated with sources in the genesis file. This allows users to have
karma available as soon a new DAppChain starts.  For example:
```json
        {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "karma",
            "location": "karma:1.0.0",
            "init": {
                "Params": {
                    "sources": [
                        {
                            "name": "sms",
                            "reward": "1"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "oauth",
                            "reward": "3"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "token",
                            "reward": "4"
                        }
                    ],
                    "users": [
                        {
                            "user": {
                                "chainId": "default",
                                "local": "QjWhaN9qvpdI9MjS1YuL1GukwLc="
                            },
                            "sources": [
                                {
                                    "name": "oauth",
                                    "count": "10"
                                },
                                {
                                    "name": "token",
                                    "count": "3"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ],
                }
            }
        }
```
This genesis file fragment will create three sources and give the user with local address
`QjWhaN9qvpdI9MjS1YuL1GukwLc` 10 rewards from `oauth` and3 rewards from `token`.
This user would than start with `10*3 + 3*4 = 42` karma.

#### Users: AppendSourcesForUser and DeleteSourcesForUser
In a running DAppChain we can add a source to a user with the karma method 
`AppendSourcesForUser`. We need a list of 
names of the new sources, plus a count of the number of rewards. Sources can be removed using 
DeleteSourcesForUser.

###### loom karma append-sources-for-user
New sources can be associated with a user using karma method AppendSourcesForUser, this can
be accessed with the `loom karma append-sources-for-user` command.
```bash
$ ./loom karma append-sources-for-user  --help
add new source of karma to a user, requires oracle verification

Usage:
  loom karma append-sources-for-user (user) (oracle) [ [source] [count] ]... [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for append-sources-for-user

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")
```
For example if `default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90` is the oracle and
`default:0xAfaA41C81A316111fB0A4644B7a276c26bEA2C9F` the user to which we want to add new
sources.
```bash
$ ./loom karma append-sources-for-user default:0xAfaA41C81A316111fB0A4644B7a276c26bEA2C9F  default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90 "oauth" 4 "token" 3 -k ./cmd/loom/data/pri
sources successfully updated
``` 

###### loom karma delete-sources-for-user
Existing sources can be disassociated with a user using the karma method DeleteUsersForUser.
For this you can use the `loom karma delete-sources-for-user`.
```bash
$ loom karma delete-sources-for-user --help
delete sources assigned to user, requires oracle verification

Usage:
  loom karma delete-sources-for-user (user) (oracle) [name]... [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for delete-sources-for-user

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")
```
For example if `default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90` is the oracle and
`default:0xAfaA41C81A316111fB0A4644B7a276c26bEA2C9F` the user to which we want to remove sources.
```bash 
$ ./loom karma delete-sources-for-user default:0xAfaA41C81A316111fB0A4644B7a276c26bEA2C9F  default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90 "oauth" "token" -k ./cmd/loom/data/pri
sources successfully deleted
```
###### loom karma get-user-state
To get the list of sources that have been associated with a user, you can use the loom
command `loom karma get-user-state`.
```bash
$ loom karma get-user-state --help
list the karma sources for user

Usage:
  loom karma get-user-state (user address) [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for get-user-state

Global Flags:
  -a, --address string   address file
      --chain string     chain ID (default "default")
  -k, --key string       private key file
  -r, --read string      URI for quering app state (default "http://localhost:46658/query")
  -w, --write string     URI for sending txs (default "http://localhost:46658/rpc")
```
For example, if `default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90` is the user 
you are curious about
```bash
./loom karma get-user-state default:0xDeffe041cC978a193fCf0CE18b43b25B4592FC90
```
 
 
## Karma methods
The following methods can be called by anyone.
* ` GetSources(ctx contract.StaticContext, ko *types.Address) (*ktypes.KarmaSources, error)` 
Returns the current karma configuration details. This includes the current sources.
* `GetTotal(ctx contract.StaticContext, params *types.Address) (*karma.KarmaTotal, error)` Returns 
the total amount of karma in the system. The sum of the karma for each user that has been 
associated with a source.
* `GetUserState(ctx contract.StaticContext, user *types.Address) (*karma.KarmaState, error)`
Returns the sources and counts associated with a user.

Can only be called by referencing the oracle unless there is no oracle yet.
* `UpdateOracle(ctx contract.Context, params *ktypes.KarmaNewOracleValidator) error`

The following methods can only be called by referencing the oracle
* `ResetSources(ctx contract.Context, kpo *ktypes.KarmaSourcesValidator) error`
Reset the list of possible sources.
* `AppendSourcesForUser(ctx contract.Context, ksu *karma.KarmaStateUser) error` 
Associate a collection of sources with counts with a user. See above for details. 
* `DeleteSourcesForUser(ctx contract.Context, ksu *karma.KarmaStateKeyUser) error` Disassociate a 
collection of sources with a user. See above for details. 

 
Other methods
* `Meta() (plugin.Meta, error)`
* `Init(ctx contract.Context, req *InitRequest) error`
  
## Genesis entries
An example genesis file entry is shown below. The Init block can be empty, which just installs
the karma contact on the DAppChain. 
You can define an Oracle in the genesis file. If you don't you can still call the karma
method `UpdateOracle` to create an initial Oracle.
It is possible to initialise the karma contract with a list of karma sources. If you do this, you
can also allocate a list of users to have allocated amounts of these sources.
