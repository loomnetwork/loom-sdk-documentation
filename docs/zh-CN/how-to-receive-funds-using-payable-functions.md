title: How to Receive Funds Using Payable Functions
---

## Purpose

A `payable` function is a special type of function that can receive ETH. This way, the developers can require a certain payment to the contract to execute a function.

This tutorial shows how you can receive funds using payable functions on Loom. This tutorial is laid out in a fashion that allows you to use it as a reference while you’re building your DApp and is intended for readers who have prior exposure to JavaScript programming and Solidity.

## Prerequisites

* **Node.js 10** or higher. To check out if Node.js is installed on your computer, issue the following command in a terminal window:

```Bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is already installed, you'll see something like the following:

```
v10.15.3
```

If Node.js is not installed, you can download the installer from the [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page.

* Git. To check if Git is installed on your system enter, type the following command:

```Bash
git version
```

If Git is installed on your computer, you'll see something like the following:

```Bash
git version 2.18.2
```

If Git is not installed, you can refer to the [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) page for details about installing Git.

* A Rinkeby account with some ETH in it.

## 1. Setting Things Up

To showcase how `payable` functions work, we've written a simple Solidity contract called `PayableDemo`, and added a user interface on top of it.

In this section, we'll walk you the steps required to clone the `loom-examples` repo and deploy the `PayableDemo` contract.

1. First, let's clone the `loom-examples` repository. Fire up a new terminal window, move into your projects directory, and enter the following command:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-examples.git
```

2. Move into the `loom-examples` directory and then install the dependencies with:

```Bash
cd loom-examples && npm install
```

3. To deploy the `PayableDemo` smart contract, you need a private key. Use the following command to generate a private key:


```Bash
npm run gen:loom-key
```

The above command saves your private key into the `loom/loom_private_key` file:

```Bash
ls -la loom/loom_private_key
```

```
-rw-r--r--  1 andrei  staff  88 Feb 24 23:14 loom/loom_private_key
```


1. At this point, you can deploy the `PayableDemo` contract by entering the following command:

```Bash
npm run migrate:payable-demo
```

If everything went well, you should see something like the following printed to the console:

```
> eth-signing@1.0.0 migrate:payable-demo /Users/andrei/Documents/test/loom-examples
>  cd loom && npx truffle migrate --network extdev -f 6 --to 6

## 2. Transfer ETH to your Loom account

Now that you've deployed the `PayableDemo` contract let's transfer some ETH to your Extdev account.

1. Run the following command to start the `loom-examples` demo:

```Bash
npm run start
```

The above command starts a web server on port 8080.

2. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you'll see something similar to the screenshot below:

![Loom Examples](/developers/img/loom-examples-home-page.png)

3. Select `Deposit ETH` and follow the instructions:

![Deposit ETH to Extdev](/developers/img/deposit-eth-to-extdev.png)

This transfers `0.2` ETH from Rinkeby to Extdev.

☞ The transfer gateway waits for **10 blocks** to be confirmed on Rinkeby. Thus, it'll take a bit of time until the balances are updated.

## 3. Call the payable function

1. Move back to the [Loom Examples Landing page](http://localhost:8080) and, this time, select `Payable Demo`:

![Select Payable Demo](/developers/img/select-payable-demo.png)

This shows the `Payable Demo` page:

![Payable Demo Page](/developers/img/payable-demo-page.png)

In the above screenshot, note that the balance of the `PayableDemo` contract is `0`.

2. Select the `Test Payable Function` button, and you will be  prompted to sign a message:

Once you sign the message, you'll notice that your Extdev balance has decreased by `0.001` ETH, and the `PayableDemo` contract balance has increased by the same amount:

![Payable Demo Contract Updated Balance](/developers/img/payable-demo-contract-updated-balance.png)

## 4. Withdraw the Funds from Your Contract

In this section, we'll show how you can withdraw the funds from the `PayableDemo` smart contract.

1. In a terminal window, move into the `loom-examples` directory, and then issue the following command:

```
npm run payable-demo:withdraw-funds
```

You'll see something like the following:

```Bash
> eth-signing@1.0.0 payable-demo:withdraw-funds /Users/andrei/Documents/test/loom-examples
>  node scripts/withdraw-from-payable-demo-contract

0x240F14c57a3F48B277109046FaC35cA09C6F5E2E has withdrawn 0.001 ETH.
Owner's balance: 0.001
```

Things to note:

* In the above output, `0x240F14c57a3F48B277109046FaC35cA09C6F5E2E` is the test account we used to deploy the contract. Your address will be different.

* The private key for this account has been generated in step `1.3`, and you can find it in the `loom/loom_private_key` file.


## 5. The Payable Demo - Under the Hood

The purpose of the previous sections was to show how you can run our demo. In the next sections, I'll briefly walk you through the code.


### 5.1 The `PayableDemo` Smart Contract

The `PayableDemo` smart contract implements two functions- `buySomething` and `withdrawFunds`

Let's take a look at the `buySomething` function:


```JavaScript
function buySomething() external payable {
  require(msg.value >= 0.001 ether, "You must send at least 0.001 ETH");
  // Implement your logic here
  emit BuySomething(msg.sender);
}
```

Things to note:

* The `payable` keyword makes it possible for you to call a function and send ETH to the contract at the same time.
* The amount of ETH sent is available in the `msg.value` variable.
* We intentionally omitted the logic of the `buySomething` function because it's outside the scope of this tutorial. We've left a comment in the code to indicate where you should place your logic.

The purpose of the `withdrawFunds` function is to let the owner withdraw funds from the contract:

```JavaScript
function withdrawFunds() public onlyOwner {
  uint balance = address(this).balance;
  require(balance > 0, "Balance should be > 0.");
  msg.sender.transfer(balance);
  emit WithdrawFunds(msg.sender, balance);
}
```

In the above listing, note that the `onlyOwner` modifier makes it so that only the owner can call this function.

### 5.2 The Front-End

We've placed the front-end code in the `src/PayableDemo/PayableDemo.js` file. Let's take a look at what's inside.

First, we import a couple of things:

```JavaScript
import {
  Address,
  Contracts
} from 'loom-js'
import { EventBus } from '../EventBus/EventBus'
import networkConfigs from '../../network-configs.json'
import { UniversalSigning } from '../UniversalSigning/UniversalSigning'
import PayableDemoJSON from '../../loom/build/contracts/PayableDemo.json'

const EthCoin = Contracts.EthCoin
```

Next, similarly to our other examples, we declare a new class that inherits from [UniversalSigning](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-examples/blob/master/src/UniversalSigning/UniversalSigning.js):

```JavaScript
export default class PayableDemo extends UniversalSigning {
   ...
}
```

To initialize the demo, the `load` function is invoked:

```JavaScript
async load (web3Ethereum) {
  this.extdevNetworkConfig = networkConfigs.networks['extdev']
  const { web3Loom, accountMapping, client } = await super._load(web3Ethereum)
  this.accountMapping = accountMapping
  this.web3Ethereum = web3Ethereum
  this.web3Loom = web3Loom
  this.client = client
  await this._getContracts()
  setInterval(async () => {
    await this._updateBalances()
  }, 2000)
  }
```

We're using `setInterval` to call the `_updateBalances()` function every two seconds. This is because `EthCoin` is a native Go contract, and it doesn't emit events.

#### 5.2.1 Instanting the Smart Contracts

Once we've initialized the demo, we have to instantiate  the `PayableDemo` and `EthCoin` contracts:

```JavaScript
  async _getContracts () {
  const payableDemoContractAddress = PayableDemoJSON.networks[this.extdevNetworkConfig['networkId']].address
  this.payableDemoContract = new this.web3Loom.eth.Contract(PayableDemoJSON.abi, payableDemoContractAddress)
  this.ethCoin = await EthCoin.createAsync(
    this.client,
    this.accountMapping.ethereum
  )
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Updating Balances

As you've seen in the previous section, the web page displays the user's balances on Rinkeby and Extdev, together with the `PayableDemo` contract's balance.

The following functions update these balances:

```JavaScript
async _updateBalances () {
  const mainNetBalance = await this._getMainNetBalance()
  const loomBalance = await this._getLoomBalance()
  const payableDemoContractBalance = await this._getPayableDemoContractBalance()
  EventBus.$emit('updateBalance', { mainNetBalance: mainNetBalance, loomBalance: loomBalance, payableDemoContractBalance: payableDemoContractBalance })
}

async _getPayableDemoContractBalance () {
  const contractAddress = PayableDemoJSON.networks[this.extdevNetworkConfig['networkId']].address
  const wei = await this.ethCoin.getBalanceOfAsync(Address.fromString(`${this.client.chainId}:${contractAddress}`))
  return this.web3Ethereum.utils.fromWei(wei.toString(), 'ether')
}

async _getMainNetBalance () {
  const wei = await this.web3Ethereum.eth.getBalance(this.accountMapping.ethereum.local.toString())
  return this.web3Ethereum.utils.fromWei(wei.toString(), 'ether')
}

async _getLoomBalance () {
  const loomAddress = Address.fromString(this.accountMapping.loom.toString())
  const wei = await this.ethCoin.getBalanceOfAsync(loomAddress)
  return this.web3Loom.utils.fromWei(wei.toString(), 'ether')
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Calling the Payable Function

When calling a `payable` function you must specify the amount of ETH you want to send. Apart from this, calling a `payable` function is not different from calling any other function. Here's the code that calls the `buySomething` function:

```JavaScript
async pay (amount) {
  const ethAddress = this.accountMapping.ethereum.local.toString()
  try {
    await this.payableDemoContract
      .methods
      .buySomething()
      .send({ from: ethAddress, value: this.web3Loom.utils.toWei(amount) })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Failed to call the buySomething function.')
    throw error
  }
}
```

### 5.3 The Withdraw Funds Script

When the user sends ETH to the `PayableDemo` contracts, it gets stored in the contract's account, and it will be trapped there unless you provide a way to withdraw the ETH from the contract. This is why we've added the `withdrawFunds` function. As you've seen, we invoke it  by executing a Node.JS script called `withdraw-from-payable-demo-contract.js`. The most relevant part of this script is listed below. If you want more context, you can find the full source code for this script in the at [GitHub](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-examples/blob/master/scripts/withdraw-from-payable-demo-contract.js)


```JavaScript
(async () => {
  const { account, web3js, client } = loadExtdevAccount()
  const { payableDemoContract, ethCoin } = await getContracts(web3js, client, account)
  const payableDemoContractBalance = await ethCoin.getBalanceOfAsync(Address.fromString(`${client.chainId}:${payableDemoContractAddress}`))
  if (payableDemoContractBalance.toString() === '0') {
    console.log('The balance of the contract is 0. Nothing to withdraw.')
    client.disconnect()
    process.exit(0)
  }
  filterEvents(payableDemoContract, web3js)
  try {
    await payableDemoContract.methods.withdrawFunds().send({ from: account })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Something went wrong: ${error.message}`)
  }
  const ownerBalanceInWei = await ethCoin.getBalanceOfAsync(Address.fromString(`${client.chainId}:${account}`))
  console.log(`Owner's balance: ${web3js.utils.fromWei(ownerBalanceInWei.toString(), 'ether')}`)
  client.disconnect()
})()
```

As you can see, the code checks that the balance of the contract is greater than zero. If yes, then it calls the `withdrawFunds()` function. Lastly, it reads the owner's balance and prints it to the console.
