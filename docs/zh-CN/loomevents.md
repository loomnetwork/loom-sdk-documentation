## Emitting events

Events emitted from smart contracts and [go plugins](./goloomevents). These events can be subscribed to in two ways

### Event structure

The event JSON shown above is wrapped in some transaction specific metadata before being emitted to the event stream. The other fields in the metadata include Called address, the contract address, the contract name and the raw transaction request data.

Below is an example of the full message that goes into redis -

```json
{
  "caller": {
    "ChainID": "default",
    "Local": "2DiOmpX+kSRZK0jxEgxdGuPC0eo="
  },
  "address": {
    "ChainID": "default",
    "Local": "4ojW7scVDWoi/eM/CqLYHgZZHE0="
  },
  "plugin": "etherboycore:0.0.1",
  "blockHeight": 65,
  "encodedData": "eyJPd25lciI6ImdvZGJvbGUxIiwiTWV0aG9kIjoic2F2ZXN0YXRlIiwiQWRkciI6IjJEaU9tcFgra1NSWkswanhFZ3hkR3VQQzBlbz0iLCJWYWx1ZSI6MTAxMH0=",
  "rawRequest": "CglTYXZlU3RhdGUSGhIIZ29kYm9sZTEaDnsiVmFsdWUiOjEwMTB9"
}
```

The `rawRequest` and the `encodedData` are base64 encoded with a standard encoding.

## Subscribing via Redis

By default the loom-sdk will only emit events to the log. To configure it to send it to a redis sorted set, add the following line to the loom.yaml config file.

    EventDispatcherURI: "redis://localhost:6379"
    

This will start emitting events to the redis server in a sorted set called `loomevents`. Each event is added to the sorted set with the score being the blockchain height.

## Subscribing via websockets

The Loom SDK query endpoint can be used to subscribe to the event stream as well. Here is sample subscription code using a command line and the [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat2) nodejs cli.

    $ cat command.json
    {
        "method": "subevents",
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "params": [],
        "id": "dontcare"
    }
    
    $ wscat -k ws://localhost:46658/queryws < command.json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "dontcare",
      "result": {}
    }{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "0",
      "result": {
        "caller": {
          "ChainID": "default",
          "Local": "2DiOmpX+kSRZK0jxEgxdGuPC0eo="
        },
        "address": {
          "ChainID": "default",
          "Local": "4ojW7scVDWoi/eM/CqLYHgZZHE0="
        },
        "plugin": "etherboycore:0.0.1",
        "blockHeight": 65,
        "encodedData": "eyJPd25lciI6ImdvZGJvbGUxIiwiTWV0aG9kIjoic2F2ZXN0YXRlIiwiQWRkciI6IjJEaU9tcFgra1NSWkswanhFZ3hkR3VQQzBlbz0iLCJWYWx1ZSI6MTAxMH0=",
        "rawRequest": "CglTYXZlU3RhdGUSGhIIZ29kYm9sZTEaDnsiVmFsdWUiOjEwMTB9"
      }
    }
    

The first json in the cli ouptut is the response of the subscribe command. The following json is an event from a contract processing a transaction.

### Example go code

You can refer to [a demo indexer](https://github.com/loomnetwork/etherboy-core/blob/master/tools/cli/indexer/etherboyindexer.go) which uses the redis and websocket event subscriptions to read the events and persist to elasticsearch. (Note that this code is meant only for demonstration purposes).
