Loom supports EVM ([Ethereum Virtual Machine](evm.html)) and plugin-based smart contracts. Plugin-based smart contracts can be created with [go-loom](https://github.com/loomnetwork/go-loom), for example.

In this example, we will demostrate how to use the Unity SDK to communicate with plugin-based smart contracts.

## Sample Code

You can find all the code on this page and a ready-to-go Unity scene in the Loom Unity SDK under [`Assets/LoomSDK/Samples/QuickStart`](https://github.com/loomnetwork/unity-sdk/tree/master/UnityProject/Assets/LoomSDK/Samples/QuickStart).

## Connecting to a DAppChain

The `Contract` class provides a convenient way to interact with a smart contract running on a Loom DAppChain. Let's write a method that creates a `Contract` instance to interact with the sample [BluePrint](https://github.com/loomnetwork/weave-blueprint/blob/master/src/blueprint.go) smart contract provided in the Loom SDK...

```csharp
// LoomQuickStartSample.cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;
using Loom.Unity3d;
using Loom.Unity3d.Samples;

public class LoomQuickStartSample : MonoBehavior
{
    async Task<Contract> GetContract(byte[] privateKey, byte[] publicKey)
    {
        var writer = RPCClientFactory.Configure()
            .WithLogger(Debug.unityLogger)
            .WithHTTP("http://127.0.0.1:46658/rpc")
            .Create();

        var reader = RPCClientFactory.Configure()
            .WithLogger(Debug.unityLogger)
            .WithHTTP("http://127.0.0.1:46658/query")
            .Create();

        var client = new DAppChainClient(writer, reader)
        {
            Logger = Debug.unityLogger
        };
        // required middleware
        client.TxMiddleware = new TxMiddleware(new ITxMiddlewareHandler[]{
            new NonceTxMiddleware{
                PublicKey = publicKey,
                Client = client
            },
            new SignedTxMiddleware(privateKey)
        });
        var contractAddr = await client.ResolveContractAddressAsync("BluePrint");
        var callerAddr = Address.FromPublicKey(publicKey);
        return new Contract(client, contractAddr, callerAddr);
    }
}
```

## Writing data to a DAppChain

To mutate the state of a smart contract you need to call one of its public methods, to do so a signed transaction must be sent to and validated by the DAppChain. Fortunately the `Contract` class takes care of most of this when you use the `Contract.CallAsync()` method.

The [BluePrint](https://github.com/loomnetwork/weave-blueprint/blob/master/src/blueprint.go) smart contract has a public `SetMsg` method that can be called to store an association between a key and a value, note that this method doesn't return anything. Let's add a method to the `LoomQuickStartSample` class that calls `BluePrint.SetMsg()`.

```csharp
async Task CallContract(Contract contract)
{
    await contract.CallAsync("SetMsg", new MapEntry
    {
        Key = "123",
        Value = "hello!"
    });
}
```

Smart contract methods that mutate state may return a value. The [BluePrint](https://github.com/loomnetwork/weave-blueprint/blob/master/src/blueprint.go) smart contract has a public `SetMsgEcho` method that will store a key/value and return the key/value it stored. Let's add another method to the `LoomQuickStartSample` class to call `BluePrint.SetMsgEcho`.

```csharp
async Task CallContractWithResult(Contract contract)
{
    var result = await contract.CallAsync<MapEntry>("SetMsgEcho", new MapEntry
    {
        Key = "321",
        Value = "456"
    });

    if (result != null)
    {
        // This should print: { "key": "321", "value": "456" } in the Unity console window.
        Debug.Log("Smart contract returned: " + result.ToString());
    }
    else
    {
        throw new Exception("Smart contract didn't return anything!");
    }
}
```

## Reading data from a DAppChain

To read the state of a smart contract you need to call one of its public read-only methods, calling a read-only method doesn't modify the smart contract state. You can call a read-only method on a smart contract by using the `Contract.StaticCallAsync()` method.

The [BluePrint](https://github.com/loomnetwork/weave-blueprint/blob/master/src/blueprint.go) smart contract has a public `GetMsg` method that can be called to look up an association between a key and a value. Let's add a method to the `LoomQuickStartSample` class to call `BluePrint.GetMsg`.

```csharp
async Task StaticCallContract(Contract contract)
{
    var result = await contract.StaticCallAsync<MapEntry>("GetMsg", new MapEntry
    {
        Key = "123"
    });

    if (result != null)
    {
        // This should print: { "key": "123", "value": "hello!" } in the Unity console window
        // provided `LoomQuickStartSample.CallContract()` was called first.
        Debug.Log("Smart contract returned: " + result.ToString());
    }
    else
    {
        throw new Exception("Smart contract didn't return anything!");
    }
}
```

## Putting it all together

Add the following method to the `LoomQuickStartSample` class.

```csharp
// Use this for initialization
async void Start()
{
    // The private key is used to sign transactions sent to the DAppChain.
    // Usually you'd generate one private key per player, or let them provide their own.
    // In this sample we just generate a new key every time.
    var privateKey = CryptoUtils.GeneratePrivateKey();
    var publicKey = CryptoUtils.PublicKeyFromPrivateKey(privateKey);

    var contract = await GetContract(privateKey, publicKey);
    await CallContract(contract);
    // This should print: { "key": "123", "value": "hello!" } in the Unity console window
    await StaticCallContract(contract);
    // This should print: { "key": "321", "value": "456" } in the Unity console window
    await CallContractWithResult(contract);
}
```

Now that we have all the code in place let's test it out:

1. Create an empty `GameObject` in a Unity scene and attach the `LoomQuickStartSample` script to it.
2. Deploy the [BluePrint](https://github.com/loomnetwork/weave-blueprint/blob/master/src/blueprint.go) smart contract on a local Loom DAppChain node.
3. Hit `Play` in the Unity Editor.
