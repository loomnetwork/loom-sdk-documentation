## Emitting events from go-plugins

The loom sdk gives gives a facility for the contracts to emit events that can be used for multiple purposes such as indexng. Currently the loom sdk supports emitting events into a Redis sorted set.

### Configuring the loom sdk

By default the loom-sdk will only emit events to the log. To configure it to send it to a redis sorted set, add the following line to the loom.yaml config file.

    EventDispatcherURI: "redis://localhost:6379"
    

This will start emitting events to the redis server in a sorted set called `loomevents`. Each event is added to the sorted set with the score being the blockchain height.

### Emitting events

The code snippet below shows sample code for emitting events from the contract.

```go
    emitMsg := struct {
        Owner  string
        Method string
        Addr   []byte
    }{owner, "createacct", addr}
    emitMsgJSON, err := json.Marshal(emitMsg)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("Error marshalling emit message")
    }
    ctx.Emit(emitMsgJSON)
```

### Subscribing to events
