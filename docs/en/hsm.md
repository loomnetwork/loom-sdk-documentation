## Overview

Hardware security modules ensure that the private keys of the validator are not compromised even if a machine is hacked. We are highly encouraging all validators on Basechain to have one for starters. In the future, we may require the use of an HSM to participate as a validator.


## Supported Devices

Right now, we will only support devices that can do EDDSA encryption with the ED25519 algorithm. Currently, we support the [Yubico HSM2](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubihsm/), an economically cheap device at around $500. It supports a wide array of encryption algorithms, including those used for bitcoin/ethereum signing. Also, we'll soon support other PKCS11 enabled devices that can do EDDSA encryption.

## Configuring an HSM

In loom.yml you need to add the following section:

```yaml
HsmConfig:
  HsmEnabled: true
  HsmDevType: yubihsm
  HsmConnUrl: "localhost:12345"
  HsmAuthPassword: "password"
  HsmAuthKeyId: 1
  HsmSignKeyID: 0
```

## Config options

* HsmEnabled

Must be set to true to enable signing with the HSM device.  If set to false, the other setting are ignored.

* HsmDevType:

Options - yubihsm, softhsm (coming soon), pkcs11 (coming soon)

* HsmConnUrl:

HTTP URL for the yubicohsm. By default it listens to http://localhost:12345

* HsmAuthPassword:

Password for the HSM device. (previously HsmDevLogCred)

* HsmAuthKeyId:

The ID number for authentication on the yubico hsm. This typically will be set to 1 as its the default AuthKeyId.

* SignKeyDomain:

With Yubico HSMs, you can allow multiple domains for security. Otherwise, it defaults to 1.

* HsmSignKeyID:

The ID number of the private key on the HSM. We suggest creating this in advance. If you set this value to zero, Loom SDK will attempt to create a new private key on the HSM itself.

## Setting up the Yubico HSM

1. Download yubico drivers, utils:

[https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/)

**We require version 1.04 or greater.**

2. Install the yubico drivers:
```bash
dpkg -i *.deb
```

3. Run the yubico connector:
```bash
yubihsm-connector -d
```

4. Create your first private key:
```bash
yubihsm-shell
connect
keepalive 25
session open 1 password
generate asymmetric 0 100 label_eddsa_sign 1,2,3 export_under_wrap,asymmetric_sign_eddsa ed25519
session close 0
quit
```

You should now have a key at with ID 100. Please set `HsmSignKeyId` to `100` in your `loom.yml`.



### Using HSM for signing transactions like Register Candidate

1. Find out your PrivateKeyId and base64 public key:
```bash
cat chaindata/config/priv_validator.json
```

Get `key_id` and `pub_key/value`.

2. Create an `hsm.json` file:

```json
{
    "YubiHsmConnURL":"localhost:12345",
    "AuthKeyID":1,
    "Password":"password",
    "PrivKeyID":999999
}
```

Put your key id into the `privKeyID` field.


3. Run the following:
```bash
./loom call register_candidateV2 PUBLIC_KEY_IN_BASE64 10  --hsmconfig hsm.json -r http://dposv2.dappchains.com:80/query -w http://dposv2.dappchains.com:80/rpc  --chain dposv2
```

Swap `PUBLIC_KEY_IN_BASE64` for the one in the `priv_validator`.
