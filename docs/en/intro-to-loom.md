Hello Developer, 

This documentation will show you how to easily deploy your dapp to Loom Network and enjoy the benefits of practical blockchain interoperability.

## What is Loom Network?

Loom Network is a multichain interoperability platform — live in production — that's connected to other major blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Tron.

Deploy your dapp just once to Loom Network's Basechain and reach the largest user base possible, so you can simply focus on your dapp development and business growth.

Enjoy having no gas fees for users, 1 – 3 second confirmation times, and automatically get connected to every major blockchain using any kind of wallet.

## What is Basechain?

Basechain is an interoperable DPoS blockchain that is live in production, EVM-compatible, audited, battle-tested, and secured by [21+ validators](https://wallet.loomx.io/validators) as well as thousands of individual token delegators.

If you've ever deployed to Ethereum, the process is very similar. And if you already have a dapp on Ethereum, you can port it to Basechain in no time — for much greater scalability and reach.

Not only are we interoperable with the major blockchains of today, but we will actively support new networks and protocols as they emerge.

Don't get locked in or build in a silo. Future-proof your dapp with Loom Network — deploy once and get multichain usability.
