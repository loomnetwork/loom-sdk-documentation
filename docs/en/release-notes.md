## Loom 2.0 Release Build 1263 - 2109/09/10

This is a maintenance release that fixes several issues and adds some new features.

**Bugfixes:**

- Setting `eth_getBlockByNumber` to `latest` while getting information about a block returns the last committed block rather than the one before it.
- Improved reliability with regard to how broken YubiHSM sessions are refreshed. Thanks to Certus One for the fix!
- Account nonces are incremented for all committed transaction, regardless of whether it was successful or not. This reduces the likelihood of clients receiving a `Tx already exists in cache` error after an EVM transaction reverts.
- The `loom reset` command now deletes `evm.db` in addition to `app.db`.

**New features:**

- Additional validation in Transfer Gateway
- Enables the on-chain config (an extension of the feature flag system)
- Reduces the amount of data stored on-chain for migration transactions.
- Improved generation & indexing of EVM events when Go contracts call EVM contracts.
